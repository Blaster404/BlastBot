# BlastBot
A utility bot written in discord py.


# Project
I decided to create this bot for utility purposes. It's kind of hard to find a utility bot that can do multiple things at the same time, for example i wanted to infuse music and moderation commands together into a bot.
I also wanted to work on this project i have been thinking for a long time. I wanted to learn some javascript next year so hopefully i'll come around with a better bot next year! This is my first time making a discord bot by scratch and i wanted to see what it takes to be a bot developer. I know i could've use a api wrapper like pycord or pypi but i decided i will make it simple and use discord py instead.
I will come back later next year with a better bot, for now, this bot is it.

# Steps to import source code and get your bot running
1. You can use gitclone to import my repo into yours.
2. If you are not using git clone, copying and pasting is also fine. Make sure you have a IDE (Visual Studio Code, Atom etc.) make a file named similar to the file names i included and post your code there.
3. Have fun and run your bot. If you want 24/7 hosting, use a hosting service. For example, replit, or IBM cloud.

If you would like free hosting, this is your best option: Free Hosting with IBM Lite (This text is taken from LucasYT, he makes good discord bot tutorials.
https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free/ \n
How to set it up: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli

You may have also heard from heroku, but you should not use it as it's not only extremely limited on what you can do, but it's also underpowered, which will cause massive performance issues in some processes of your bot.

From the FAQ of a lite account:

- The account is free - no credit card required.
- The account never expires.
- You can use one org in one IBM Cloud region.
- You receive email notifications about your account status and quota limits.
- Your Cloud Foundry apps can access up to 256 MB of free, instantaneous runtime memory per month.
- You can provision one instance of any service in the IBM Cloud catalog External link icon that has a Lite plan.
- After 10 days of no development activity, your apps go to sleep. You can wake up your apps by continuing to work on them.
- After 30 days of no development activity, your service instances with Lite plans are deleted.

For a simple bot that will only be in 2 or 3 servers, this is a good choice, but if you plan on expanding, go with a paid service or buy a raspberry pi
