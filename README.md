# BlastBot
A utility bot written in discord py.


# Description
I decided to create this bot for utility purposes. It's kind of hard to find a utility bot that can do multiple things at the same time, for example i wanted to infuse music and moderation commands together into a bot.
I also wanted to work on this project i have been thinking for a long time. I wanted to learn some javascript next year so hopefully i'll come around with a better bot next year! This is my first time making a discord bot by scratch and i wanted to see what it takes to be a bot developer. I know i could've use a api wrapper like pycord or pypi but i decided i will make it simple and use discord py instead.
I will come back later next year with a better bot, for now, this bot is it.
<br/>
NOTE: For now this bot only has utility commands and some commands functionality, and it does not have music functionality, i will update the code if i added a working music function.

NOTE2: Although this bot doesnt match today's bot standards, please note that this is my first time developing a discord bot. Next year i hope to make a better bot with more functionality to it.

# Steps to import source code and get your bot running
1. You can use gitclone to import my repo into yours.
2. If you are not using git clone, copying and pasting is also fine. Make sure you have a IDE (Visual Studio Code, Atom etc.) make a file named similar to the file names i included and post your code there.
3. Have fun and run your bot. If you want 24/7 hosting, use a hosting service. For example, replit, or IBM cloud. You can also use a raspberry pi to host your discord bot. It's hard to find a free hosting service, if you want quality hosting services then paid hosting services is one way.
